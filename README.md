O Me! O Life!
BY WALT WHITMAN
(abridged by me!)

Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring...
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d...
What good amid these, O me, O life?

Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.
